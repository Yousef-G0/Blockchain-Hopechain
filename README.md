# HopeChain ðŸŒ±

HopeChain is a decentralized donation platform built with **Solidity** for the smart contract backend and a simple animated **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend.  
It uses **Ganache** to deploy the contract locally and generate the ABI and contract address for frontend integration.

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to create transparent and immutable donation systems.

## âœ¨ Features
- Smart contract written in Solidity to handle donations and store them transparently on the blockchain.
- Integration with **Ganache** to deploy and test locally.
- Frontend built with **HTML**, **CSS animations**, and **JavaScript** to interact with the blockchain.
- Automatically retrieves the contract ABI and address after deployment for frontend connection.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Ganache (for local blockchain)
- HTML, CSS (with animations), JavaScript
- Web3.js (to connect frontend with blockchain)
